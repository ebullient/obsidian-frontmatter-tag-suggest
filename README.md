## Obsidian Frontmatter Tag Suggest

Autocompletes tags in the YAML frontmatter. It will show an autocompletion menu if you are on a line starting with `tags:` or `tag:`.

This plugin is useful since Obsidian only shows the tag autocomplete with a # character, but if you use a # character in the `tags:` frontmatter, the file will not be considered under that tag. This plugin removes the need to have to go back and delete the # character on any stock autocompleted tags.
